title: SkillsUSA
description: In 2017 we began mentoring a middle school SkillsUSA, a program
  that ended when the four middle schools in our district were merged into one.
  However, we continue to see the impact of this program, with many of our
  current high school robotics students having been on this middle school team.
  These students have explained that this middle school program was the reason
  they wanted to join.
