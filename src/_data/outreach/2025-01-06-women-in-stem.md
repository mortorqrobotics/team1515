description: "MorTorq champions diversity and inclusivity, particularly through
  our Women in STEM initiative. Our Women in STEM panels address the historic
  gender gap in STEM fields by exposing girls to successful women in STEM. Our
  panels include women in a variety of fields to speak at our school and
  interact with students, uplifting the voices of women in often male dominated
  fields and inspiring students to pursue their passions. "
