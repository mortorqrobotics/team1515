  Our team participates in the annual Walk4FriendshipLA, which raises funds for
  Friendship Circle, a non-profit organization supporting individuals with
  special needs. Our team members have volunteered over 500 hours and raised
  over $2,000 demonstrating our commitment to creating a more inclusive
  community. By visiting Friendship Circle and organizing various STEM
  activities, we have fostered long-lasting relationships and inclusion within
  our community. Our team members are paired with a buddy in our weekly events
  to guide them in building parts of an FTC-like robot. Our strong relationship
  with Friendship Circle has enabled us to provide STEM to everyone.
