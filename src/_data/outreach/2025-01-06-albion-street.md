title: Albion Street
description: For over 10 years, our team has annually visited our sister school,
  Albion Street Elementary. Albion, serving a majorly underprivileged community,
  suffers from underfunding and limited parental involvement but provides
  much-needed education to the children it serves. During these visits, we
  deliver gifts and showcase our robot, exposing younger generations to the
  world of STEM. Our visits have engaged children in STEM and inspired them to
  create their own robotics team.
