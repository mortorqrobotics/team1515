role: Machine Specialist
description: Hi, my name is Isabel Lo. I'm a junior and the machine specialist
  for Mortorq. This is my third year on the team and my role is to oversee the
  operation of machine tools in the workshop. My objective on the team this year
  is to make sure that everyone on the team is sufficiently trained on all
  machinery, while providing team members with hands-on engineering experiences
  and manufacturing skills that can be used in the real world. I'm excited to
  see what we will get to build this year!
