  Hi! My name is Arianna Matcuk. I am a sophomore and one of two electrical
  specialists on Mortorq! I learned a lot as an intro student last year and have
  been refining my skills this fall. My primary responsibility is to wire the
  mechanisms and assemble the electrical components of the robot. I am super
  ecstatic about our team and the upcoming build season!
