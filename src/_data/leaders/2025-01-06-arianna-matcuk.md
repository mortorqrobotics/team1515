description: Hi! My name is Arianna Matcuk, and I am a junior. This is my third
  year on the team, and my second year as the electrical specialist. My role
  involves wiring the robot's mechanisms and components, as well as mentoring

  continuously search for ways to improve every aspect of our robot. I am
  looking forward to competing in build season!
