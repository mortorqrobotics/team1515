description: Hello, my name is Xander Matcuk. I have been on Mortorq team 1515
  for four years, and I have loved every second of it. Currently, I am the
  team's Mechanical Chief, responsible for leading robot construction; teaching
  design, CAD, and how to use machines; and manage various subgroups to ensure
  cooperation. This year, I am excited to be able to lead this wonderful team
  and give back to its newer members just like previous leadership did for me.
  After high school, I wish to pursue mechanical engineering, and being on this
  team has equipped me with many of the necessary skills, from design and
  critical thinking to mechanical and leadership. Anyway, I can't wait to
  compete this season and I look forward to continue to work with, or at least
  stay in touch with, the team long after I graduate.
