  Hello, my name is Xander Matcuk.

  I have been at Mortorq, FRC team 1515, for 3 years and have found every moment
  of it exhilarating. As a build specialist, I help lead the team through robot
  creation and design. Most often, I work at computer aided design (CAD),
  ensuring that the designs of the team can be visualized and assembled
  precisely. Additionally, outside of build season, it is my responsibility to
  teach CAD to new team members and make certain that returning members are
  proficient in CAD and design as well. Overall, this program has been
  incredibly valuable. From machining and designing, to life skills like
  cooperation and leadership, I have learned much. I cannot wait to compete this
  build season, and, as all always, lets go Mortorq!
