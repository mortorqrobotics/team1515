name: Elizabeth Yerushalmi
role: "President of programming "
description: Hi! My name is Elizabeth Yerushalmi, and I’m a senior in high
  school as well as the president of the programming team. I joined the team as
  a sophomore and spent two years working with our previous programming
  president before stepping into the role myself. My goal is to introduce new
  students to what our programming team does - what languages we use, the skills
  they’ll need to master, and how we work together to bring our robots to life.
  In addition to teaching, I’m responsible for programming the robot to operate
  autonomously and integrating it with the teleoperation systems used by our
  drivers.
