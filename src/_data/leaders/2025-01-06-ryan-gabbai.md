name: Sophie Hong
role: "Build Specialist "
description: Hi! I'm Sophie Hong, a junior and this year’s Build Specialist. I
  focus on the mechanical side of our robot—helping design and fabricate parts,
  and supporting team members as they learn about different mechanisms and
  hands-on building techniques. I’ve been part of the team since my freshman
  year, and it’s been one of the most rewarding and memorable parts of my high
  school experience. I’m so excited for the 2025–2026 season and can’t wait to
  see what we’ll create together!
