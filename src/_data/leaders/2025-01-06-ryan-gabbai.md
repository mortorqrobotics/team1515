description: >
  Hi I am Ryan! I am a machine specialist for Mortorq 1515 and in 11th grade. I
  joined the team in 9th grade as I wanted to make friends and pursue my
  interest in biomedical engineering. Furthermore, this class has taught me so
  much about the inter mechanics of machines, which I personally had not known
  before. In the end, this class has brought out the best in me as every day I
  look forward to bonding with my friends either it be through building or
  teaching.
