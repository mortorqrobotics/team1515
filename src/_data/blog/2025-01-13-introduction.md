  school robotics team, participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC).
  As part of the FIRST community, our team thrives on principles of teamwork,
  innovation, and hands-on learning to inspire the next generation of engineers,
  entrepreneurs, and leaders. The team, composed of talented high school
  students, works together to design, build, and program robots that compete in
  challenging, real-world-inspired competitions. In addition to building robots,
  Mortorq is also home to an active Robotics Business Club. This student-run
  program focuses on the entrepreneurial aspects of robotics, along with
  community outreach. The business club ensures that students gain valuable
  skills in managing projects, communicating with potential partners, and
  creating a sustainable team environment. They organize events such as the
  Women in STEM panels, and events where we showcase our robots to younger
  children to encourage them to pursue STEM. Both the robotics team and business
  club work together to develop not only technical expertise but also leadership
  and collaboration skills that will serve students well in their future
  careers. Mortorq Robotics is more than just a team—it's a community of young
  innovators who are learning, growing, and preparing to tackle the challenges
  of tomorrow's technological landscape. With the support of mentors, coaches,
  and sponsors, Mortorq Robotics continues to push the boundaries of what’s
  possible, fostering a spirit of discovery and excellence."
